Note: Music is copyright, and I have not included the sample audio files in the source code in GitHub
      but the Silents have a free download album which you can download as follows.
  
  1) http://silents.bandcamp.com
  2) Under Digital Album, click on Free Download
  3) Click the Format menu, and select AAC, MP3, Flac or Ogg Vorbis - it will say 'preparing'.
  4) When completed, download the ZIP file to the appropriate folder; AAC, MP3, Flac or Ogg Vorbis
  5) Unpack the ZIP file contents into that folder

The AAC folder already contains MD5 checksums for the files. As these might change from those I 
downloaded you can always recreate the MD5 checksum values.  I used the MD5 Checker tool which you
can download from here, http://md5-checker.tsoft.qarchive.org/
